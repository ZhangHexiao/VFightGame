# Generated Files

This directory contains auto-generated files from SwiftGen.

**Do not edit these files manually** - they will be overwritten on build.

Generated files include:
- `Assets+Generated.swift` - Strongly-typed asset accessors
- `Colors+Generated.swift` - Color definitions from Resources/Colors.txt  
- `Strings+Generated.swift` - Localized string accessors

To regenerate these files, run:
```bash
swiftgen config run
```

Or build the project if SwiftGen is configured as a build phase.
